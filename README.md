# DotNet API With JWT
DotNetAPIWithJWT is a sample project on GitHub that demonstrates how to build a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core and implement JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. The project is built using C# programming language and utilizes Entity Framework Core for database operations.

 Users can register, login, and then access the protected endpoints of the API using the JWT token issued upon successful authentication.

The project includes the following features:

- JWT-based authentication and authorization
- User registration and login using hashed passwords
- CRUD operations on the "Todo" resource
- Database operations using Entity Framework Core
- Swagger documentation for the API endpoints


The project can be used as a starting point for building secure APIs using ASP.NET Core and JWT authentication.
